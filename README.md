# code-refractor

I was able to add certain elements to clean up the code. I added header, and footer while also fixing the nav bar to link to a different part in the website.
I added a title at the top to describe what website it is.
I added alt attributes to the images to help with acccessibility.
I changed class names to concise css style atrributes.
